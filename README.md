# VBA_Text_Encryption_Tool
You can use the VBA (macro) included with MS Excel to decrypt the decrypted electronic wallet address or password you want to encrypt the sentence (diary, password of various sites). There are already many encryption algorithms on the Internet, but my algorithms are implemented differently than known algorithms.

How to Use

Open Tool File> Encrpytion Tool.xlsm
Â 
Type Plain Text (anything)

Alt + F8> Run Macro "EncA"> input password you want
You can see that plaintext is digested to encrypted text

and if you want to decrypt text
Alt + F8> Run Macro "DecA"> input password you want
