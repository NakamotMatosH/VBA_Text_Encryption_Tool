VBA_Text_Encryption_Tool

This tool allows you to use the VBA (macro) functionality in MS Excel to encrypt cryptocurrency wallet addresses, website passwords, or any text you want to secure (e.g., diary entries, private secrets). While there are many encryption algorithms available online, my approach is uniquely implemented, offering a different method than conventional algorithms.

How to Use:

1. Open the tool file: Encryption_Tool.xlsm


2. Type the plain text (anything you want to encrypt).


3. Press Alt + F8 and run the macro "EncA." Enter the password of your choice.
The plain text will be encrypted into ciphertext.


4. To decrypt the text, press Alt + F8 again, run the macro "DecA," and enter the password you used for encryption.



If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to contact me. I'm based in South Korea.

P.S. The source code is provided as a .bas file, and the .xlsm file contains explanations and is executable in Excel.
