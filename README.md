# VBA_Text_Encryption_Tool
You can use the VBA (macro) included with MS Excel to encrypt the cryptocurrency wallet address or web site password or some text you want to encrypt (ex. diary, private secrets). 
There are already many encryption algorithms on the Internet, but my algorithms are implemented differently than well-known algorithms.

How to Use : 

Open Tool File> Encrpytion Tool.xlsm
Â 
Type Plain Text (anything)

Alt + F8> Run Macro "EncA"> input password you want
You can see that plaintext is digested to encrypted text

and if you want to decrypt text
Alt + F8> Run Macro "DecA"> input password you want



I am in Republic of Korea(south) and if you are interested, please contact me 

ps. The source code is a .bas file. (.xlsm is executable excel file and there are some explaination in it)
